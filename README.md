🚀 Project Workflow

Importing Libraries – Setting up Python environment with essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Loading Dataset – Preparing the dataset for regression analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding the data using visualization and statistical summaries.

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling.

Model Building – Implementing Linear Regression using Scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation – Measuring model performance using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

Visualization – Plotting regression line, residuals, and predictions vs actual values.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy, Pandas – Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

📊 Key Insights

Linear Regression is effective for understanding relationships between independent and dependent variables.

Residual analysis helps in validating model assumptions.

Model accuracy depends on data quality and preprocessing steps.

🔮 Future Improvements

Try Polynomial Regression for nonlinear data.

Compare with other regression models (Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree).

Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask.
